# CommentNow Web App
This is an API made for the Seminar - Software Workshop class. This project was developed by a team of five people led by me. This API was made for a simple social network that any user could use from their web browser.
## Description

This web application was built with JavaScript and React. Just like Storybooks was used for React component documentation.

For the web application to work, it has to be connected to an API of the same name made by this same team. Here is the API repository:
